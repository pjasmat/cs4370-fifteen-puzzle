Fifteen Puzzle 

Team Members: Faizaan Hyath, Rebekah Aung, Asmat Ullah

Project Summary: The "Fifteen Puzzle" is a sliding tile game involving 15 numbered tiles arranged in a 4x4 grid with one empty space. The user’s goal is to restore the tiles to their original sequence by sliding them into the blank space. Our project will implement this game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL to support the functionality of the game.

Proposed Wireframe:
The homepage displays a stylized Fifteen Puzzle board with a random background image and a “Shuffle” button.
The board contains 15 movable tiles and one blank space.
When the game is solved, a notification is displayed on the screen.
Admin page (optional) provides tools for managing user accounts and background images.

Homepage Details:
CSS-styled puzzle theme with modern visuals.
Displays game title, background selector, and shuffle/start button.


Layouts:
CSS Grid for the tile layout (4x4).
Responsive Flexbox wrapper around the game.

Each Page Details:
Index.html:

Functionality:
Validates whether a tile can move based on its position relative to the blank.

Transition Implementation Details:
Tile movements are animated using CSS transitions for smooth sliding.
Page changes and image updates triggered using DOM event listeners.

Transformations Implementation Details:
Hoverable tiles have green text and red borders to indicate interactivity.
Win notification includes transformed victory banner or visual cue.

Approach to Refine Improvements:
Incorporate user feedback to optimize the user interface and streamline the user experience. 
Iterate on design elements based on usability testing results to ensure intuitive navigation and clear information presentation.
